## Design Philosophy

### Why These Technologies?

1. **Performance First**: Vite provides near-instant development server startup and HMR, while React's efficient rendering ensures smooth user experience.

2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript catches errors before runtime, reducing bugs and improving maintainability.

3. **Developer Experience**: Modern tooling like Vite, TanStack Query, and React Hook Form reduce boilerplate and improve productivity.

4. **Accessibility**: Radix UI primitives ensure WCAG compliance and keyboard navigation out of the box.

5. **Scalability**: Component-based architecture and design system tokens make it easy to maintain and scale the application.

6. **User Experience**: Smooth animations, responsive design, and intuitive UI patterns create a delightful user experience.

7. **Modern Best Practices**: Semantic HTML, HSL colors, design tokens, and consistent spacing follow industry standards.

## Design System Features

- **Gradient Theme**: Blue (#4F9CF9) to Purple (#9B7EF4) creates a modern, professional look
- **Semantic Tokens**: All colors defined as CSS variables for easy theming
- **Custom Animations**: Fade-in, float, and smooth transitions enhance UX
- **Shadow System**: Soft and glow shadows for depth and focus
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints for all devices
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast ratios and ARIA labels throughout

## Optional Enhancements (Not Implemented)

While not required for the current scope, these could be added:

- **Framer Motion** - Advanced animations
- **React Query DevTools** - Development debugging
- **Storybook** - Component documentation
- **Testing Library** - Unit and integration tests
- **Cypress** - End-to-end testing
- **SASS/SCSS** - Although Tailwind handles most styling needs elegantly
